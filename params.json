{"name":"Wells Fargo Analytics Competition","tagline":"","body":"### Data Processing\r\nData Processing began with a dataset that was a rat's nest of information that was unorganized. In this dataset, there are Twitter submissions that regard respective banks. This dataset is broken down from a list of information into comprehensible groups. Banks are the first to be filtered, followed by the topics of discussion, then to Sentiment Analysis (emotional reactions to banks filtered through topics).\r\n\r\n### Classifier.R \r\nThis was an approach to label the whole dataset by building a decision tree. We exported 1000 random records of the data set and labeled them by hand. Unfortunately the tree we got wasn't very helpful therefore we filter the topics by searching for special words (load_filter_data.R). Below is the an attempt to create topics in which individual Twitter submissions fall into regarding content.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'atm'\r\natm.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"atm\",x)))\r\n\r\n# find messages with the topic 'online'\r\nonline1.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"online\",x)))\r\nonline2.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"app\",x)))\r\n\r\n# find messages with the topic 'investment'\r\ninvestment1.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"investor\",x)))\r\ninvestment2.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"investment\",x)))\r\n\r\n# find messages with the topic 'fraud'\r\nfraud.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"fraud\",x)))\r\n\r\n# find messages with the topic 'service'\r\nservice.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"service\",x)))\r\n\r\n# find messages with the topic 'fee'\r\nfee.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"fee\",x)))\r\n\r\n# find messages with the topic 'job'\r\njob1.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"interview\",x)))\r\njob2.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"recruiting\",x)))\r\njob3.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"recruitment\",x)))\r\njob4.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"job\",x)))\r\n\r\n```\r\n![Topics](http://i.imgur.com/EobP4p5.png)\r\n\r\n### Filtering Banks\r\nThis code shown below was an attempt to take the mess of information and, based on the bank being mentioned, filter the submissions. Sentiment is an important filter that is taken into consideration and is weighted heavily in determining general satisfaction of the public in regard to each bank. The image shown immediately below the code shown below is a box plot representing the sentiment score of each bank. \r\n```R\r\n# Filter banks\r\nbankA.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"banka\",x)))\r\nbankB.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"bankb\",x)))\r\nbankC.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"bankc\",x)))\r\nbankD.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"bankd\",x)))\r\n\r\n# Enter new column with bank name\r\n# initialize with 'No'\r\ndf$BankID = \"No\"\r\ndf$BankID[bankA.idx] = \"BankA\"\r\ndf$BankID[bankB.idx] = \"BankB\"\r\ndf$BankID[bankC.idx] = \"BankC\"\r\ndf$BankID[bankD.idx] = \"BankD\"\r\n\r\n#remove the bank indexes \r\nrm(bankA.idx)\r\nrm(bankB.idx)\r\nrm(bankC.idx)\r\nrm(bankD.idx)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Sentiment Score](http://i.imgur.com/0709ESD.png)\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\nEach topic when they stand alone a very elementary, but when all of the topics come together, they can easily be mixed up or mistaken with one another. Once a visual is created in the form of a bar graph, one can easily see the frequency of each topic's appearance. The content within the dataset is not always filled with positive feedback, often times, the information that is being processed is regarding problems people are having in each respective topic.\r\n\r\n#### Online\r\nThe topic, \"online,\" includes items in the dataset that are referring to online processes such as online banking or issues with online interfaces.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'online'\r\nonline1.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"online\",x)))\r\nonline2.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"app\",x)))\r\n```\r\n#### ATM\r\nThe topic, \"ATM,\" is a straight forward topic that refers to data in the dataset that is involving the ATM machines that each bank services. More often than not, the feedback regarding ATMs are negative, stating problems that a person is having with the machines.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'atm'\r\natm.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"atm\",x)))\r\n```\r\n#### Investment\r\nThis topic refers mostly to investment banking as well as putting money away for future investments via each individual bank.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'investment'\r\ninvestment1.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"investor\",x)))\r\ninvestment2.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"investment\",x)))\r\n```\r\n#### Fraud\r\nAlmost always negative, this topic has to do with fraud. Either the exceptional use of fraud protection that each bank makes available to the consumer or the lack of fraud protection leading to fraudulent activity in someone's account without their knowing.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'fraud'\r\nfraud.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"fraud\",x)))\r\n```\r\n#### Service\r\nGenerally, this topic is referring to the assistance someone received at the bank or over the phone, both positive and negative.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'service'\r\nservice.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"service\",x)))\r\n```\r\n#### Fee\r\nBank fees are the way banks stay in business, without these fees, the banks would ultimately close. The fees however are often times subjects for complaints due to the displeasure one feels after paying a fee.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'fee'\r\nfee.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"fee\",x)))\r\n```\r\n#### Job\r\nThis topic refers to the experiences someone had while applying for a job or receiving a job from the respective banks.\r\n```R\r\n# find messages with the topic 'job'\r\njob1.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"interview\",x)))\r\njob2.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"recruiting\",x)))\r\njob3.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"recruitment\",x)))\r\njob4.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"job\",x)))\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
